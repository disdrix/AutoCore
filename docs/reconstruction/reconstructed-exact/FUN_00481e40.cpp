// System:    unknown
// Generated: 2026-07-23 from raw capture (scaffold; refine for important units)

// Stable ID: aa_00481e40
// Embedded strings (evidence for future rename):
//   - "

// READABILITY (auto CF):
//  - Body size: ~14 non-empty decompiler lines.
//  - Control keywords: if×1, return×1.
//  - Notable callees: fprintf×2, FUN_00481e40, acts, author, exit, free, n.
//  - Return sites: 1.

/*
 * Behavioral notes:
 * - Derived from Ghidra decompile; names prefer Ghidra symbols / plate comments.
 * - Remaining FUN_* / DAT_* identifiers are unresolved pending type recovery.
 * - Runtime / differential verification: OPEN unless matrix says otherwise.
 *
 * Readability pass:
 * - undefinedN widths preserved as fixed-width integers where decompiler width is known.
 * - Control flow and call order preserved from authoritative raw.

The 1007 assertion\njust happens to cross-check the results of huge numbers of\nmemory reads/writes, and so acts (unintendedly) as a stress\ntest of your memory system.\n\nI suggest the following: try compressing the file again,\npossibly monitoring progress in detail with the -vv flag.\n\n* If the error cannot be reproduced, and/or happens at different\n  points in compression, you may have a flaky memory system.\n  Try a memory-test program.  I have used Memtest86\n  (www.memtest86.com).  At the time of writing it is free (GPLd).\n  Memtest86 tests memory much more thorougly than your BIOSs\n  power-on test, and may find failures that the BIOS doesn\'t.\n\n* If the error can be repeatably reproduced, this is a bug in\n  bzip2, and I would very much like to hear about it.  Please\n  let me know, and, ideally, save a copy of the file causing the\n  problem -- without which I will be unable to investigate it.\n\n"
